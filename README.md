# Euler-projects-Largest-palindrome-product
The largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# About The Project

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. https://projecteuler.net/

This is the fourth problem in the series. The challenge was to find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Added : Find out how many palindromes are in the series of the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Built with:

The solution was built with Javascript ES6. Javascript concepts used:

Nested for loops, conditional if statements, string and array methods, fuction apply method, set

# What I learned:

I am learning better how some of these string and array methods work.

effectively used the function apply method to find the maximum number in the series instead of using a for loop.

How to create and use 'set' to make the values in the series to a collection of unique values.

Explored the use of console.time()/console.timeEnd() to measure how fast a program runs.
